# FXMaps
A new JavaFX Mapping API which allows you to embed Google Maps in your JavaFX application and combines two API's (GMapsFX and google-maps-services-java) to allow one to easily use functionality missing in both, such as:

Draw and plot routes and objects on your google map using JavaFx
Use Google APIs such as Directions API and GeoCoding API - which the GMapsFX API doesn't offer!

* The above allows you to add routes to a map either by hand or by file, and automatically SNAP routes to the nearest road or highway - when desired.
* Open source so you can add features too!
